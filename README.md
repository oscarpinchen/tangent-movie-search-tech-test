### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Things I would continue to develop with more time:

- Would include an 'Add to Top Films' functionality so that the top films list wasn't just a static list of pre-determined films
- Would make it so that clicking on any of the top films would call the API and display more information about them
- The app might benefit from an option to search for a film via an IMDB ID number so that the search is more reliable. In its current guise, the app tends to return the most recent version of a film if its a film that's been remade with the same title.
- Would include an error catch for failed API requests, including a way to display this to users
- Add a theme switch function for users who prefer dark-mode
- Expand upon the current styling, including inclusion of animation to add visual interest to the page
